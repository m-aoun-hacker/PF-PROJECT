The goal of this phonebook management system is to provide a comprehensive and efficient tool for storing, retrieving, and managing contact information. Designed with scalability and user-friendliness in mind, the system allows users to perform various operations such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts. Additionally, it includes robust features like data persistence through file storage, seamless loading and saving of contact information, and the ability to create backups to prevent data loss. The use of functions for modularity ensures the code is maintainable and extensible, making it easier to add new features or optimize existing ones. This project serves as a practical implementation of file handling, structures, and user interaction in C programming, emphasizing real-world application development principles.
